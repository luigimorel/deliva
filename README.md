## Deliva

Deliva is a hypothetical food delivery API that can be used to:

1. Track food orders by a restaurant's customers
2. Assign orders to the riders (An asumption that the restaurant has an in-house delivery section)
3. Track the customers orders
4. Track the delivery time and distance for the customers
5. Assign chefs to certain orders by the customers.

### Motivation

###### Main Goal

The main goal of this repo is to improve my knowledge about domain driven software development in the construction of APIs in the different industries.

#### Why Choose GraphQL?

Below is a summary of the adavantages of GraphQL as extracted from this article <a href="
    https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/#:~:text=GraphQL%20lets%20you%20ask%20for,their%20own%20unique%20data%20specifications.
    ">Why use GraphQL</a>

-   No end point versioning
-   Smaller payloads since only the required resources are fetched
-   Better client performance
-   Less time spent documenting and navigating APIs
-   Better error handling
-   Legacy app support

### Project set up

**System Requirements**

-   MongoDB
-   NodeJS
-   Package Manager (Yarn or NPM )

**Installation**

```
1. yarn add
```

Then

```
2. node src/app.js
```

#### PS

Please note that this is not a production ready API. So many things are lacking.
